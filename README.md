# Frontend-Tasks

Get accustomed with the basics of HTML and CSS, then dive into the Universe of JavaScript.
Before you start, few points: 
* If you are new to frontend you should start with projects in Category A. 
* If you have some experience with HTML/CSS, start with category B. 
* If you’re an expert in HTML/CSS and have a good knowledge of JS you can start with Category C. 
* If you’re a God, start with Category D.  
* In most projects a layout of the design is specified. In those cases you have to come up with your own design to make it look attractive.
* All design SHOULD be responsive.

## Category A:

Make a fandom website
Pick any book/movie/TV show that you like. Create a website to showcase info about it/ why you like the show/book - a review if you’d like.

### Project A.1 : Create a responsive navigation
Create a horizontal navigation bar that displays the title of the show/book/movie on the left and few links on the right (like Home, Characters, Analysis/Review, Quiz, Gallery, etc)
When viewing on mobile, the links are displayed in a hamburger menu and the title is still displayed on the horizontal bar.

### Project A.2 : Create the home page
Add content to the home page 
Make it look good using adequate CSS
Add any animation to the page. Example: Glowing text, Sliding images, etc.

### Project A.3 : Create the characters section
Each character should be associated with a card that contains its picture, name, and other information about it.
All characters would be displayed as a grid of cards (use CSS flexbox/grids for ease) - similar to how a member section of a website of a company looks.
Ex: https://www.finastra.com/about/executive-team, https://webengage.com/partners-program/ 

## Category B:

### Project B.1 : Make a quiz
User score is displayed at the end.

On clicking a ‘+’ button, users can add items to list
User can select and mark items as Done
User should be able to delete items

## Category C:

### Project C.1 : Design ACM Logo
Design a new ACM logo using CSS clip path. Have a look at http://species-in-pieces.com/# and design the logo on similar grounds.

### Project C.2 : Make To Do List changes permanent
Currently whenever you reload the page, the list details are reset. Make use of Cookies or Browser local storage to store the changes saved in the browser such that even when you reload the page the changes are visible.

### Project C.3 : Working with an API
